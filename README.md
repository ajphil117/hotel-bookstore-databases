# Hotel and Bookstore Database Management
This project gave me the opportunity to create and manage realistic databases for a hotel and bookstore and reflect on each organisation's data requirements.
Over the course of 4 weeks, I designed a complete database using SQL for each organisation utilising basic security measures so each was secure. 

This project taught me the importance of data security and the complexity of data storage/management.

​The list of tasks required to complete this project can be seen below.

## Project Tasks
### 1. Database Creation
Task 1 required me to create a database that matched the provided Rmap.

After creating the database, tables, attributes, constraints, Primary Keys, and Foreign Keys had to be created.

### 2. Query Database
Task 2 required me to query the database based on a list of questions that needed answering.

An example of this is to write a query to list the hotel number, type, and price of each double or deluxe room with a price more than $99.

### 3. Insertion and Deletion
Task 3 required me to insert and delete data based on a set of instructions.

An example of this is to write an INSERT command to add a new hotel. The hotel is called ‘Quest Beachside’ and it’s located in Surfers Paradise.

### 4. Indexes and Views
Task 4 required me to create an index and a view based on a set of instructions.

An example of this is to write a command to create an index on the roomNo column of the room table.

### 5. Administration
Task 5 required me to perform database administration commands based on a set of rules.

An example of this is user Vanessa is no longer allowed to add data to the guest table.
